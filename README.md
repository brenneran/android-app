## Gitflow Workflow

This project follows the **Gitflow workflow**:

- **`main` branch**: Contains the production-ready code.
- **`develop` branch**: Contains the latest development changes.
- **Feature branches**: For developing individual features.
- **Release branches**: For preparing production releases.
- **Hotfix branches**: For quick fixes in the production code.

## GitHub Actions

The repository includes a pre-configured GitHub Actions workflow:

- Triggers on pushes to the `develop` and `release/*` branches.
- Builds the app using Gradle.
- Generates an APK artifact.
- Publishes the APK to a Telegram group.

### Workflow Configuration

- Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:
  - `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`: The token of your Telegram bot.
  - `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`: The chat ID of the Telegram group.

## Usage

1. Create a new feature branch for your development:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature
   ```

2. Commit your changes and push to the repository:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add new feature"
   git push origin feature/your-feature
   ```

3. Merge the feature branch into `develop` once the feature is complete.

4. For releases, create a release branch and follow the workflow:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b release/v1.0.0
   git push origin release/v1.0.0
   ```

5. GitHub Actions will automatically build and publish the release APK to the Telegram group.
